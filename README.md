# RandomFilePicker
Picks a random file from a list and runs it.

Simple, multi-use application for picking a random file. This can be used with ROMs, Steam games, videos, music, or any file.

You can select a folder and add all items, including items in subfolders. You can also filter by extensions. You can specify a program to open, or use the default program. You can also add command prefixes to run programs that have parameters for file input.
